# Smart-Exam-Scheduler-and-Viewer
This project is a web-based Exam Allotment System using PHP and MySQL. Admin inputs course code, semester, batch, and date. The system checks if any student has another exam on that date and prevents clashes. It ensures conflict-free scheduling based on existing exam records in the database.
